1) Explain the difference between primitive and reference data types with examples.

Ans:

Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are the basic types of data built into the language and serves as a fundamental building block. They represent single values and are stored in stack memory.
                      There are 8 types of Primitive Data Type:
                      1. int: Used to store 32-bit signed integer. Example: int num = 10;
                      2. long: Used to store 64-bit signed integer. Example: long num = 10;
                      3. float: Used to store 32-bit floating-point.
                      4. double: Used to store 64-bit floating-point.
                      5. char: Used to store 16-bit Unicode character.
                      6. boolean: Used to represent true or false.
                      7. byte: Used to store 8-bit signed integer.
                      8. short: Used to store 16-bit signed integer.
Reference Data Types:

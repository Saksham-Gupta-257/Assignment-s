4) Explain the concept of encapsulation with a suitable example.

Ans: 

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java that involves bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It increases security of the data as the attributes can
only be accessed using its methods.

Advantages of encapsulation:
1. Data Hiding: Encapsulation hides an object's internal details, exposing only necessary information through a public interface.
2. Flexibility: Internal implementation can be modified without affecting external code.
3. Maintainability: Private fields with public getters and setters make code easier to maintain.

Example:
public class Student {
 private String name;
 private int roll_no;
 
 public String getName() {
     return name;
 }
 
 public void setName(String name) {
     this.name = name;
 }
 
 public int getRollNo() {
     return roll_no;
 }
 
 public void setRollNo(int roll_no) {
     this.roll_no = roll_no;
 }
}

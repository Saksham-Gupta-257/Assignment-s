1) Explain the concept of interfaces and abstract classes with examples.

Ans:

Interface : An interface in java is a collection of abstract methods. It is used to achieve abstraction i.e. it contains only abstract methods. It acts as an reference like a class. Apart from abstract methods it can also contain constants, default and static methods.
            Example:
            interface Circle { 
                public void area(); 
                public void perimeter(); 
            }

Abstract Class: An abstract class is a class in java which cannot be instantiates by itself. It serves as blueprint for other classes which inherits it. It contains both methods with definition and abstract methods(methods without definition).
                It provides a base for its child classes to extend and implement the abstract methods or override concrete methods .

                Example:
                abstract class Circle {
                    abstract void area();  
                    public void print_line() {     
                        System.out.println("Area of Circle.");
                    }
                }

                class Rectangle extends Circle {
                    @Override
                    void area() {
                        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle.");
                    }
                }
